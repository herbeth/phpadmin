## AdminPanel Info
AdminPanel was a project started after owning a community and my admins not knowing fully how to use database admin tools, so I created a very user friendly panel instead!

The panel also has access to Rcon, meaning your server can be maintained and run without the need to be in-game or even your computer!

### Donate

Donations are much appreciated!

### Screenshots

See the AdminPanel in action <a href = "https://www.flickr.com/photos/140721778@N03/albums/72157667459890313">here!</a>

### Download

Download the latest version from <a href = "https://github.com/Jason2605/AdminPanel/releases">here!</a>

### Install

Just drop these files into a webserver. Everything else is configured from the panel itself so no need for file configuration!
Note - The DB info is that of your Arma 3 Altis Life Database.

Default user is Username: AdminPanel Password: Admin1234
Please change this after the first login.

The Default API Username and Password if not specified: Username: default Password: password

Thanks for the support!
